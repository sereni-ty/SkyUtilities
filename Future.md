# Thoughts

+ Papyrus load minimizer:
  + (Check): Amount of (active) scripts
  + (Check): Event (Custom or native) registration frequency
  + (Check): Pending events (load)
  + (Action): Rescheduling or, if mod is known (Configuration?), removal of event

+ Net: Retrieval of mod versions from Nexus and Loverslab. Not sure if achieveable. Could be valuable though.
